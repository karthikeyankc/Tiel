# Tiel
A simple computer robot in Python that learns from the user and responds based on the input.
## Description
This is a fun project I do when I am bored. It doesn't use NLP yet. Therefore, it is a simple and trivial program, which strictly responds only if the user asks or chats with accurately trained set of sentences.
## How do I train Tiel?
Just run the script. A SQLite database `memory.db` will be created with a table with two fields to store all your inputs and the corresponding training responses as you train Tiel. You can either ask and train the robot or hack your way into to the database and add your own statement and response combinations.
## Plans
* Supercharge Tiel with NLTK.
* Teach emotions (add more fields).
* Take over the world.
